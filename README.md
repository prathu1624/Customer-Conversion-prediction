# Customer-Conversion-prediction
Final project in Data Science course by GUVI.
This is a project based on machine learning.
Our task is to predict how likely a client will subscribe to the insurance scheme.
To train the ML models we have used historical data of the insurance company.
On this data, we perform data cleaning and check for imbalanced data.
We then use exploratory data analysis to check for trends and the contribution of unknown values to proceed with encoding.
Then we perform "Label" or "One-hot" encoding based on the data.
Then we split the data into training and testing.
Then we balance the training data and scale it.
We then insert the data into ML models like Logistic regression, KNeighbours classifier, and Decision tree classifier.
We have used the "AUROC" metric to evaluate the model.
Then we perform ensembling techniques using models like XGBOOST to improve the prediction.
