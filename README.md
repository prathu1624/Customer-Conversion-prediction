# Customer-Conversion-prediction
Our goal is to forecast the chances of a client joining an insurance program.
We went on a voyage through the annals of historical data from the insurance firm to build and fine-tune our machine-learningÂ models. Our thorough process started with data cleaning, resolving imbalances, and using exploratory data analysis to uncover trends and determine the significance of unknown variables. Following that, we implemented encoding techniques, selecting either 'Label' or 'One-hot' based on the data's complexities.
We focused on balancing and scaling the training data by dividing our dataset into training and testing subsets. The subsequent incorporation of the data into machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, KNeighbours Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier constitutes an important turning point in our study.
We used the "AUROC" metric to assess the performance of our models. To improve our forecasts, we used ensembling techniques and models like XGBOOST.
In essence, our final project represents a comprehensive approach to data science, comprising data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and advanced techniques like ensembling to improve predicted accuracy.
