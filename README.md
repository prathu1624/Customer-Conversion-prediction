# Customer-Conversion-prediction
Our objective revolves around predicting the likelihood of a client subscribing to an insurance scheme.
To construct and fine-tune our machine learning models, we embarked on a journey through the annals of historical data from the insurance company. Our meticulous process began with data cleaning, addressing imbalances, and employing exploratory data analysis to unveil trends and decipher the impact of unknown values. Subsequently, we executed encoding strategies, opting for either 'Label' or 'One-hot' based on the data's intricacies.
Dividing our dataset into training and testing subsets, we focused on balancing and scaling the training data to enhance model efficacy. The subsequent integration of the data into machine learning models—such as Logistic Regression, KNeighbours Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier—marked a pivotal phase in our project.
For evaluation, we adopted the "AUROC" metric, providing a comprehensive assessment of our models' performance. To further refine our predictions, we implemented ensembling techniques, leveraging models like XGBOOST.
In essence, our final project encapsulates a holistic approach to data science, encompassing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and advanced techniques like ensembling to enhance predictive accuracy.
